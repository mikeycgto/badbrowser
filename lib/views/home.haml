    %h1 Why use Bad Browser?
    %p 
    Some vistors to your site are using outdated browsers. These old versions can cause your site to render incorrectly or prevent certain features from working.
    
    %p 
    There is no sense in having your application parse user-agents or write browser sniffing client code. 
    These sorts of things are time comsuming and can be a misuse of resources.
    
    %p
    We built Bad Browser to solve this exact problem. Our API is able to indentify a user's browser version through their user agent. When an outdated version is detected,
    we let the user and your application know through a variety of ways.
